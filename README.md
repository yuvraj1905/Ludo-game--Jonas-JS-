# Ludo game

- First player to reach 50 Points , wins the game!!
- Player 1 initiates the game.
- Dice gives random values between 1-6.
- Getting 1 as dice value will pass the turn to other player.
- Players can get points by holding the max value they want within that particular turn.
- Players need to wisely hold the values as trying to store more and more points everytime might lead to loss of total points gained in that particular turn.
